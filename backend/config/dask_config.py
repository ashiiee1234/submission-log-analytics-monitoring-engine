# LocalCluster is a mini distributed cluser in your system, helps to run dask, as were running on mutiple systems.
#local cluster is used by developer in testing phase.

# client() is methods how python connects with dask cluster(connection between code and dask cluster)
# send tasks to worker with the help of client and process easily.

# LocalCluster -> create workers + schedule it
# Client -> connect code with dask

# LocalCluster -> Infrastructure
# client -> Interface
